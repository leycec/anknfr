Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm (Aokana)… for Linux!
================================================

This repository officially hosts [Lutris-based **Linux**
installers][lutris-aokana] for the [unofficial native Linux port][linux-aokana]
of *[Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm: Beyond the sky, into the
firmament][nekonyan-aokana]*, officially localized as *Aokana: Four Rhythm
Across the Blue* and commonly abbreviated as merely *Aokana* (あおかな). Read
the [highly-acclaimed][vndb-aokana] [shounen sports chuunibyou][chuuni] visual
novel that [spawned a derivative outpouring of anime and manga
spinoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aokana:_Four_Rhythm_Across_the_Blue#Adaptations)
in the most cultured way possible: as a native 1440p application under a Linux
distro near you.

> ⚠️

> This port is **not officially endorsed** by [NekoNyan][nekonyan],
> *[Aokana][nekonyan-aokana]*'s applause-worthy [Steam publisher][steam-aokana]
> and English localizer. We still love you, [NekoNyan][nekonyan].

## Installation

1. **Please legally purchase [NekoNyan's English localization of
   *Aokana*][steam-aokana],** because [NekoNyan][nekonyan] continually goes
   beyond the call of corporate duty to support censorship-free localization
   throughout the English visual novel community. Online storefronts include:
   * **[NekoNyan themselves][nekonyan-aokana].**
   * **[JAST][jast-aokana].**
   * **[Steam][steam-aokana].**
1. Download **Linux-compatible videos** in the language of your choice:
   * **[English and/or
     Japanese](https://www.mediafire.com/file/bhm65i1h9tx68yv/file).**
   * **[Simplified
     Chinese](http://www.mediafire.com/file/s3rai72u2je60t1/file).**
   * **[Traditional
     Chinese](http://www.mediafire.com/file/fsisjaibh73wc8v/file).**
1. Choose the installation route that's right for you:
   * **"[NekoNyan][nekonyan-aokana] or [JAST][jast-aokana], please."** But of
     course, cultured senpai! This route installs the [*Aokana Perfect
     Edition+* R18 release][steam-aokana-perfect-edition] directly purchased
     from [NekoNyan][nekonyan-aokana] or [JAST][jast-aokana] (identical to the
     uncensored Steam release detailed below). Either:
     * **(Recommended)** Install Aokana from the one-click Lutris website:
       1. Browse to the **[Lutris Aokana page][lutris-aokana]**.
       1. Click the **Install** button to the right of the "LINUX  Windows
          NekoNyan or JAST version" installer.
     * Manually install Aokana from this repository:
       1. Download our [well-tested NekoNyan-or-JAST Lutris
          installer][local-nekonyan-or-jast].
       1. Open a terminal to the directory containing that file.
       1. Copy-and-paste this command into that terminal:

              lutris -i aokana-native-nekonyan-or-jast.yml

   * **["Steam, please."][steam-aokana]** Your wish is our Linux command. Our
     Steam installers are experimental, largely untested, and possibly
     even (but hopefully *not*) broken. Please help us get a better idea of the
     state of these installers by **[submitting a new issue documenting your
     installation experience][local-issue-new].** Note that
     [NekoNyan][nekonyan]'s [vanilla Steam release of *Aokana*][steam-aokana]
     is the **censored All Ages** version. Some people like that. Some people
     don't. <sup>Obligatory shoutouts to [/r/visualnovels][r-visualnovels]
     here.</sup> Again, choose the installation subroute that's right for you:
     * **"Censored, please."** Sure thing! It's your visual novel. This
       subroute installs the [censored All Ages vanilla Steam release of
       *Aokana*][steam-aokana]:
       1. Download our [**experimental** censored Steam Lutris
          installer][local-steam-censored].
       1. Open a terminal to the directory containing that file.
       1. Copy-and-paste this command into that terminal:

              lutris -i aokana-native-steam-censored.yml

     * **"Uncensored, please."** You have chosen wisely. This subroute
       installs the [free-as-in-beer Perfect Edition+ R18 Steam DLC
       patch][steam-aokana-perfect-edition] restoring all CGs, scenes, and
       dialogues from the original Japanese release as well as adding Misaka's
       supplementary scenes from the so-called *Aokana Perfect Edition+*:
       1. Download our [**experimental** uncensored Steam Lutris
          installer][local-steam-uncensored].
       1. Open a terminal to the directory containing that file.
       1. Copy-and-paste this command into that terminal:

              lutris -i aokana-native-steam-uncensored.yml

   * **"Unspecified other sources, please."** Please legally purchase
     [NekoNyan's English localization of *Aokana*][steam-aokana] when you have
     the financial means – if you haven't already, of course. Without ongoing
     monetary support, the visual novel community will get a BAD END (which is
     bad):
     1. Download our [well-tested portable Lutris installer][local-portable].
     1. Open a terminal to the directory containing that file.
     1. Copy-and-paste this command into that terminal:

            lutris -i aokana-native-portable.yml

     4. When asked to *Select main Windows executable "Aokana.exe"*, select
        the top-level `Aokana.exe` file in the directory containing your
        portable Windows copy of *[Aokana][nekonyan-aokana]*.

You're done. Praise Misaka!

## Features

This port is a [fan-authored third-party conversion][linux-aokana] of
[NekoNyan][nekonyan]'s [original Windows-only release][steam-aokana], now
featuring:

* **Native Linux execution.** As a native Linux application, this port requires
  *no* compatibility layer (e.g., [WINE][wine] [Proton][proton]) – reducing
  runtime overhead and the usual laundry list of issues caused by these layers.
* **Linux-compatible videos.** As a native Linux application, this
  port leverages cross-platform open-source royalty-free media standards like
  [Vorbis][media-vorbis], [VP8][media-vp8], and [WebM][media-webm] rather than
  the non-cross-platform non-open-source royalty-encumbered media shipped with
  the [original Windows-only release][steam-aokana].
* **Fast save restart.** This port additionally supports a new low-level
  `--continue` command-line option substantially reducing startup times. When
  passed, this option bypasses all startup logos, the opening video (OP), the
  main menu, and the load menu by immediately loading straight into the most
  recent save. *Nice.*

## Differences

This port also features a number of *mostly* negligible differences from the
[original Windows-only release][steam-aokana], listed here for both
completeness and to avoid confusion:

* **Sprite Viewer file features unsupported.** This port does *not* currently
  support Sprite Viewer features attempting to open a file dialog, as the
  [original Windows-only release][steam-aokana] did so by opening a
  non-portable Windows-specific file dialog. This includes the following Sprite
  Viewer features:
  * Background importation.
  * Image file saving.
* **Letterboxing on window resizes.** When manually resizing the game window to
  an unsupported aspect ratio, this port currently letterboxes (i.e., surrounds
  game content with both horizontal and vertical black bars) rather than
  auto-correcting itself as in the [original Windows-only
  release][steam-aokana].
* **Unpaused audio on window minimization.** When minimizing the game window,
  this port currently fails to pause the currently playing audio if any rather
  than automatically pausing that audio as in the [original Windows-only
  release][steam-aokana].
* **Save thumbnail degradation.** As in the Switch port, this port downscales
  save thumbnails with Unity's lower-quality stock bilinear filtering mode
  rather than the higher-quality bicubic filtering mode implemented by the
  [original Windows-only release][steam-aokana].

Authoritative credit for this native Linux port goes entirely to [Unity maestro
and Fuwanovel forums contributor **loam**][loam], whose [initial post ignited
the whole shebang][loam-post]. *You are amazing and you surely know it.*
